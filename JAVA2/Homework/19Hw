Chocolate Distribution Problem
Given an integer array arr of size n, where each element represents the number of chocolates a person receives, determine the minimum difference between the chocolates distributed to the person receiving the most chocolates and the one receiving the least. Your task is to return the smallest possible difference after distributing the chocolates such that the difference between the chocolates of any two people is minimized 

Example:

Input:

n: 5

arr: 10, 4, 12, 3, 1

m=3

Output: 3

 Parking Lot Problem
You are given a parking lot represented as a character array arr of size n, where each element can either be 'S' (indicating an empty slot) or 'X' (indicating an occupied slot). Find the maximum number of cars that can be parked consecutively in the parking lot. Cars can only park in empty slots and must park in consecutive empty slots.

Example:

Input:

n: 16

arr: XXXSSSXXSXXSSXXSXX

Output:

3

 PRIME MAGIC
Some prime numbers can be expressed as a sum of other consecutive prime numbers.

For example

5 = 2 + 3

17 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7

41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13.
 
Your task is to find out how many prime numbers which satisfy this property are present in the range 3 to N subject to a constraint that summation should always start with number 2.
 
Write code to find out the number of prime numbers that satisfy the above-mentioned property in a given range.

 BUSY BEEBusy Bee is busy with her life and wants you to solve

one problem for her.

The problem is as follows:

You are given an array ‘A’ of size ‘N’ consisting of

integers.

You have to find the number of points (A[i], A[j]) and

‘i’ < ‘j’. Such that their average is greater than or

equal to ‘K’. Input:
